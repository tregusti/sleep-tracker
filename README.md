# Sleep tracker

Track the sleep of your child with this app.

The aim is to have a view for a curious child to see how many our
they have slept whenever they wake up. Red is displayed if to few,
yellow if "ok" and green if enough.

The parent just holds a finger on the device screen for 3 seconds
and the app starts counting hours.

## Lacking features
